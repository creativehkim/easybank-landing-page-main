This project was great experience to practice and execute a better sass organizing skills. The skills I used to make this landing page will make me work faster and more efficiently in the future.

### Continued development

I would like to recreate this project using React and other framworks with some javascript animation.

### Useful resources

- [Sass with auto-refresh (and more) made easy by Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYWf2m_yzBQ) - This helped me for doing scss more easily. I really liked the npm package Parcel and will use it going forward.
